# DIY-Power-Monitor

A power monitoring system is designed to help you save money on your energy bills and reduce your carbon footprint. The system works by tracking and optimizing your energy usage, so you can make informed decisions about how you consume energy.

## The system is composed of three main parts:

### Metering Device

The metering device is the component that collects raw data about your energy usage.

### Software
The software is responsible for collecting and displaying the data that is collected by the metering device. It provides a user-friendly interface for you to view and analyze your energy usage.

### Communication

The software and metering device must communicate with each other in order to exchange data. This can be done through a wired or wireless connection, depending on your specific system.
By using a power monitoring system, you can have a greater understanding of your energy usage, allowing you to make informed decisions about how you consume energy and ultimately save money on your energy bills.

## Getting Started

To get started with your power monitoring system, simply install one of these yaml files in ESPHome and connect the metering device to a circuit of your choice.

## Conclusion

A power monitoring system is a valuable tool for anyone looking to save money on their energy bills and reduce their carbon footprint. By tracking and optimizing your energy usage, you can make informed decisions about how you consume energy and make a positive impact on the environment.
